# Chapter 5 code from book **Computational Physics: Problem Solving with Python 3rd Edition**
> this is an unofficial that's done totally by me.

in this repo we will have detailed code in the formal way asked by the book.

The repo has for now only the differentiation part, and integratin will be uploaded soon. it is worth noting that there are some points that i pointed to could be improved for cleaner code.

I also tried to implement each part in a function so it could be used for various cases and with different algorithsms not just the number of them that i implemented.
The target of the algorithms here are showing the true difference between obselete, or not accurate to a degree, with what is really done by the computer behind the scene.
this chapter is important for calculus learners from all backgrounds that are also interested in computer science.

I made the function of the differentiation part applicable to add, change, or insert, through input function, any mathematical function or formula so you could see how each 
solo function differentiate in terms of mathematical model.
